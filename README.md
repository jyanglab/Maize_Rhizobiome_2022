## data

ps_noMC.rda: R phyloseq object, ASV table with 129767 ASVs and 3313 samples, filtered ASV table with mitochondria and chloroplast sequences removed (after filter step 5 in Supplementary Methods)

ps_common.rda: R phyloseq object, ASV table with 4632 ASVs and 3307 samples. Removed ASVs that were not observed in at least 5% (166) of all samples (after filter step 6 in Supplementary Methods). Includes phylogenetic tree generated with mafft/7.407 and fasttree/2.1

ps_bothyears.rda: R phyloseq object, ASV table with 3728 ASVs and 3307 samples, filtered ps_common.rda, includes all ASVs that were observed at least once in both years (after filter step 7 in Supplementary Methods). Includes phylogenetic tree generated with mafft/7.407 and fasttree/2.1

ps_asv.rda: R phyloseq object, ASV table with 3626 ASVs and 3306 samples, final set of ASVs table used in this study (after filter step 7 in Supplementary Methods).
